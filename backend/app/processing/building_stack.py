"""Pure floor-placement math for the stacked 3D building viewer (subfeature B).

Turns subfeature A's per-floor ``building_transform`` — a 2D similarity in WALL-MASK
PIXELS mapping THIS floor's mask px → the REFERENCE (lowest) floor's mask px — into a
3D ``Placement3D`` that positions the floor's GLB in the building (reference-floor)
METRIC world frame. The frontend applies it directly as ``group.scale`` /
``group.rotation.y`` / ``group.position``.

Derivation + worked identity check: ``docs/features/stacked-3d-viewer/06-pipeline-spec.md``.

NOTE: ``processing/`` is the PURE layer. This module imports ONLY ``math``,
``dataclasses`` and ``typing`` — a purity test asserts no ``cv2`` / ``numpy`` /
``app.*`` / ``fastapi`` / ``sqlalchemy`` / ``pydantic`` import.

Coordinate conventions (see 06):

- ``building_transform`` (A): ``p_ref = s·R(θ)·p_self + (tx_px, ty_px)`` with
  ``R(θ) = [[cosθ, -sinθ], [sinθ, cosθ]]``, in wall-mask pixels; lowest floor =
  identity; ``None`` = unsolved.
- GLB ground frame (MEASURED from the exported floor GLBs): a mask pixel ``(u, v)``
  maps to metric ground ``X = u/ppm``, ``Z = (v - H)/ppm`` — trimesh's Y-up export
  NEGATES the OpenCV row axis, so ``Z`` carries ``(v - H)``, NOT ``(H - v)``. Height
  is Three's Y axis. World frame = the reference floor's GLB frame.

    Closed form (06-pipeline-spec), with ``s = building_transform["scale"]`` (the RAW
    pixel→pixel scale, NOT the combined output ``σ``), ``θ = rotation_rad``::

    The floor GLB's ground maps mask px ``(u, v)`` → ``(X, Z) = (u/ppm, (v − H)/ppm)``:
    trimesh's Y-up export negates the OpenCV row axis, so ``Z`` is ``(v − H)``, NOT
    ``(H − v)``. That negated row axis is why the building-frame rotation is
    ``group.rotation.y = −θ`` (Three's Y rotation acts as ``[[cosφ, sinφ], [−sinφ,
    cosφ]]`` on ``(x, z)``; with ``φ = −θ`` it reproduces A's ``R(θ)`` after the flip).

    Args:
        building_transform: A's persisted transform dict
            (``{scale, rotation_rad, tx, ty, ...}``) in mask pixels, or ``None``
            for an unsolved/unlinked floor.
        ppm_self: this floor's pixels-per-metre.
        ppm_ref: the reference floor's pixels-per-metre.
        mask_h_self: this floor's wall-mask height in pixels (``H_self``).
        mask_h_ref: the reference floor's wall-mask height in pixels (``H_ref``).
        elevation_m: ``(number − min_number) × FLOOR_HEIGHT`` — the floor's height.

    Returns:
        A ``Placement3D`` in the reference-floor metric world frame, or ``None`` when
        the floor is unsolved (``building_transform is None``) or the metric scales
        are unusable (``ppm_self``/``ppm_ref`` non-finite or ``<= 0``) so the px→m
