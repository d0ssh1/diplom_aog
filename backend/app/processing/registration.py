"""Uniform similarity least-squares solver (Umeyama) — PURE layer.

Fits a single isotropic scale ``s``, a proper rotation ``R(theta)`` and a
translation ``(tx, ty)`` mapping section-pixel control points onto their
master-pixel counterparts::

    [X, Y] = s * R(theta) @ [x, y] + [tx, ty]

This is the closed-form least-squares similarity (Umeyama 1991), reflection-
prevented so ``scale >= 0`` always: a mirrored target maps to the NEAREST proper
rotation (``det(R) = +1``), surfacing as a large residual rather than a negative
scale. A single scalar ``s`` is applied to both axes (no shear, no per-axis
scale), so a square cabinet stays square (design AC4); no rotation (``theta ~ 0``)
is the strict sub-case reproducing the prior scale+translation fit.

NOTE: ``processing/`` is the PURE layer. This module imports ONLY ``numpy`` and
``dataclasses`` — no core config, no DB/IO/Pydantic/ORM, no OpenCV. The solver
receives ``min_baseline_px`` as an argument (the service computes it from
``R_MIN_BASELINE_FRAC``). ``DegenerateControlPointsError`` is DEFINED here: this
module is its home, and the service imports it from here.
