"""API routes for Vertical Floor Stitching (subfeature A, Phase 5).

Thin router for the three building-assembly endpoints. Each route does only:
validate (Pydantic request models) → call ``BuildingAssemblyService`` → return the
response model. ALL business logic (pairing, solve, compose, persist) lives in the
service; the router's sole extra job is mapping the service's domain exceptions
onto HTTP status codes via the single canonical table in ``_STATUS_BY_EXC``.

Paths span both ``/floors/...`` and ``/buildings/...`` so the router uses
``prefix=""`` (the ``/api/v1`` prefix is applied where the router is included).
Per-pair solve statuses (``needs_points`` / ``degenerate`` / ``no_mask``) are 200
body fields, NOT HTTP errors (../02 error table).
