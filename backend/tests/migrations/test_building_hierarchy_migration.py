Tests for f1g2h3i4j5k6_building_hierarchy migration.

These tests verify the post-migration schema state against the project's
development database (diplom3d.db), which is kept at 'head' by the dev workflow.

The test module connects to the real (already-migrated) DB in read-only mode
so it never mutates state — safe to run in CI as long as dev.db exists and is
at head.

If the DB is not at head, the fixture raises a clear error.
