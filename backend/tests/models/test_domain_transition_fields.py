"""Model + build-pipeline tests for the stair directional gates (D Phase 1).

Covers ``docs/features/floor-multifloor-routing/04-testing.md`` (Models section):
``connects_up``/``connects_down`` default True, round-trip Room↔VectorRoom, and
survive the ``normalize_coords`` rebuild in the build pipeline (the silent-drop
risk flagged in 03-decisions.md — same class of bug C fixed for elevator fields).
