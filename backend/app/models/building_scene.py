"""Pydantic models for the stacked 3D building viewer (subfeature B).

Exact JSON shapes are the contract in
``docs/features/stacked-3d-viewer/05-api-contract.md``. These models ARE that contract —
the ``GET /buildings/{id}/scene-3d`` response serialises through them. Pure declarations
only; no business logic.

``ScenePlacement`` is the metric, Three.js-ready transform the frontend applies as
``group.scale`` / ``group.rotation.y`` / ``group.position``. It is derived from
subfeature A's ``building_transform`` by the PURE ``processing.building_stack.floor_placement``
(see 06-pipeline-spec) — these models never recompute it.
