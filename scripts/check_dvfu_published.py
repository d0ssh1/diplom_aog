Sanity check: report whether the DB has any "published" buildings,
i.e. buildings with at least one Section bound to a Reconstruction
whose status == Done (3).

Highlights ДВФУ (case-insensitive substring match in Building.name) for
demo/VKR purposes.

Exit codes:
  0 — at least one ДВФУ building is published
  1 — no ДВФУ building published (or no published buildings at all)
