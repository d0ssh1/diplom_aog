"""Pure mask assembly for the stitched-floor pipeline — PURE layer.

Warps each section wall mask by its solved uniform similarity
``(scale, rotation_rad, tx, ty)``, OR-composites the warped masks into the
master-pixel canvas, and rasterises the floor connectors as OPEN-polyline wall
bands. Returns a binary ``{0, 255}`` mask ready for the unchanged
``build_mesh_from_mask`` (design pipeline spec §5.1).

NOTE: ``processing/`` is the PURE layer. This module imports ONLY ``cv2``,
``numpy`` and ``dataclasses`` — no core config, no DB/IO/Pydantic/ORM, no service.
``SectionWarpInput`` / ``ConnectorRaster`` are plain frozen dataclasses (no
Pydantic, no ORM) so the layer stays pure.

The canvas size and the per-section transforms are decided by the SERVICE: it
knows the master-schema crop dims and the memory-guard factor ``k``
(``MAX_FLOOR_CANVAS_PX``), and passes ``canvas_size`` with the transforms already
pre-multiplied by ``k`` (pipeline spec §5.2). This function only honours the
``canvas_size`` it is handed — it never derives ``k`` or reads any constant.
